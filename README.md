Like [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async), but employing promises.

### Collection functions

* `each`, `eachSeries`, `eachLimit`
* `map`, `mapSeries`, `mapLimit`
* `reduce`
* `detect`, `detectSeries`
* `filter`, `filterSeries`
* `applyEach` - WARNING: works differently than Async's `applyEach`

### Flow-control functions

* `series`
* `parallel`, `parallelLimit`
* `applyToEach` (works similar to Async's `applyEach`)

Since a promise cannot be fulfilled with multiple values, and regular chaining is already well taken care of by chaining `.then` calls, there is no equivalent to `async.waterfall`. If you have a need for using multiple results from past functions inside a new function, I suggest to take a look at [Stepthrough](https://github.com/braveg1rl/stepthrough).

### Utility functions

* `return`, `fulfill` - returns a promise that has been fulfilled with specified value.
* `throw`, `fail` - returns a promise that has failed with specified error.
* `throwHard` - only for debugging or simple scripting purposes, this method will do two things: First, it throws an error in the current tick (which will cause the promise to be rejected). After that, during the next tick, it writes the error stack to the console and ends the Node.js process with `process.exit(1)`. Doing so helps make failures visible, without needing to add manual error handling somewhere in the promise chain.
* `log` - logs the fulfillment value of a promise with `console.log`.
* `dir` - logs the fulfillment value of a promise with `console.dir`.
* `makePromise` - the function that is exported by [make-promise](http://npmjs.org/package/make-promise).
* `adapt` - converts a typical async function (with `(err, result)` callback) into a function that returns a promise.
* `collect` - pass it an array or object with promises (or a mix of promises and regular values) and when the returned promise is fulfilled, all promises in the array or object have been replaced by the value they were fulfilled with.

## Usage

Faithful mimics the [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async) API, with three important differences:

* The functions don't have a callback argument.
* The functions return a [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/) promise (powered by [make-promise](http://npmjs.org/package/make-promise))
* The iterator is not passed a callback function as its last argument. Instead, the iterator must return a promise. If the iterator throws an error or does not return a promise-like object (i.e. it does not have a `then` method), then the promise returned by the Faithful function will fail.

#### Note about CoffeeScript

All usage examples below are written in CoffeeScript, but the code made available through the package is pure JavaScript, and works perfectly fine with JavasScript code. If you are unfamiliar with CoffeeScript syntax, you could copy and paste the code examples into the CoffeeScript compiler demo at [CoffeeScript.org](http://coffeescript.org/) . When you're there, click "Try Coffeescript" in the navigation bar.

### faithful.each

```coffee
faithful.each(inputs, iterator)
  .then ->
    console.log "Everything has executed."
  .then null, (error) ->
    console.error error
```

`faithful.eachSeries` works the same, but ensures the iterator is not called with the next argument until the promise returned by the previous iterator is fulfilled.

`each` and `eachSeries` are also available as `forEach` and `forEachSeries`, respectively.

### faithful.map

```coffee
faithful.map(inputs, iterator)
  .then (outputs) ->
    console.log outputs
  .then null, (error) ->
    console.error error
```

`faithful.mapSeries` works the same, but ensures the iterator is not called with the next argument until the promise returned by the previous iterator is fulfilled.

### faithful.reduce

The iterator for `reduce` works a little differently than the regular iterators. In line with `Array.reduce` and `Async.reduce`, the iterator takes the current reduction as its first argument, and the current input value to be processed as the second. The returned promise must resolve with the new value for the reduction.

On top of that, `faithful.reduce` takes an extra argument (in the middle). This specifies the initial value of the reduction.

The example below is a pretty involved way of computing the factorial of 4 (i.e. `4 * 3 * 2 * 1`). Note that in this code, it's actually computed as `1 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 4`. The first `1` is the initial value passed.

```coffee
iterator = (reduction, value) ->
  faithful.makePromise (cb) ->
    setImmediate ->
      cb null, reduction * value
faithful.reduce([1,2,3,4], 1, iterator)
  .then (reduction) ->
    console.log reduction # 4! == 24
  .then null, (error) ->
    console.error error
```

By necessity, `faithful.reduce` does its processing serially. The value of the reduction after a particular step `i` must be known before the next step can be executed. When possible, it's advisable to first get an array of values in a parallel fashion (for example by employing `faithful.map`) and then calling `reduce` on the resulting array.

### faithful.detect

```coffee
faithful.detect(inputs, iterator)
  .then (firstMatchingInput) ->
    if firstMatchingInput?
      console.log firstMatchingInput
    else
      console.log "No input matched the criteria."
  .then null, (error) ->
    console.error error
```

`faithful.detect` gives as result the first input value for which the promises returned by the iterator was fulfilled with a truthy value (i.e. something that evalates to `true` in context of an if-statement). If no input value matched the criteria set by the iterator, then the result will be `undefined`.

Because `faithful.detect` starts with calling the iterator once for each value in the `inputs` array - before any of the promises returned have been fulfilled -, the result you'll get from `detect` will not necessarily be the first value inside the input array that matches the criteria set by the iterator. Rather, it's the result for which the promise returned by the iterator happened to be fulfilled first. Because of that, you may want to use `detectSeries` so that inputs are checked one by one, in order. With `detectSeries` you'll always get back the first among the inputs that matched the criteria.

## faithful.applyEach - different from async.applyEach

`faithful.applyEach` takes as first argument an array of argument arrays, and as second argument the iterator function you want to apply these arguments to. This is very handy for typical jobs like renaming files with `fs.rename` or writing files with `fs.writeFile`. The value for `this` for the iterator will be an empty object.

```coffee
fs = require "fs"
faithful = require "faithful"
renameFile = faithful.adapt fs.rename
renamePairs = [["a","A"],["b","B"],["c","C"]]
faithful.applyEach(renamePairs, rename)
  .then ->
    console.log "Done renaming files."
  .then null, (err) ->
    console.error err
````

The functionality of Async's applyEach is offered as `faithful.applyToEach`.

### faithful.log

`faithful.log` logs the fulfillment value of the promise using `console.log`, and the failure value with `console.error` otherwise.

```coffee
faithful.log faithful.return "abc"
# shown on console: "abc"
```

### faithtful.dir

`faithful.dir` logs the fulfillment value of the promise using `console.dir`, and the failure value with `console.error` otherwise.

```coffee
faithful.dir faithful.return abc:123
# shown on console: "{ abc: 123 }"
```

## Under the hood

All collection functions of Faithful are powered by two functions that do most of the work: `faithful.each` and `faithful.eachSeries`.

Both `faithful.each` and `faithful.eachSeries` take the following arguments: `values`, `iterator` and an optional `options` object. This options object allows you to configure the iteration process. Look at it as a configurable loop. All options are optional.

**Use with caution**: The specifics of the `options` object may well change in the future. However, I think it's too useful not to share.

### Implementation of faithful.reduce

To get a sense of how you can build something quickly which is not implemented by Faithful yet, take a look at how the `Faithful.reduce` is implemented.

```coffee
faithful.reduce = (values, reduction, iterator) ->
  faithful.eachSeries values, ((value) -> iterator reduction, value),
    handleResult: (result) -> reduction = result
    getFinalValue: -> reduction
```

#### Things of note

* The iterator passed to `map` must be slightly adapter before being passed to `eachSeries`, because `eachSeries` calls the iterator with only the a value from the values array, while the iterator passed to `map` also takes a `reduction` argument (as it's first argument).
* `handleResult` is called for every promise that is fulfilled. In this case, the result is assigned to the local `reduction` variable (note its listes in the `reduce` function arguments).
* When every promise is fulfilled, the promise that `eachSeries` returns will be fulfilled with the value returned by `getFinalValue`.

### Implementation of faithful.detect

```coffee
faithful.detect = (values, iterator) ->
  found = false
  foundValue = undefined
  faithful.each values, iterator,
    handleResult: (result, index) ->
      return unless result # did iterator find a match?
      foundValue = values[index] # look up the value that made the iterator match
      found = true # remember that we found something
    getFinalValue: -> foundValue # fulfill promise with the found value
    stopEarly: -> found # stop the processing when we found something
```

#### Things of note

* In contrast to the implementation of `faithful.reduce` shown above, here the iterator gets passed on unchanged to `faithful.each`.
* `handleResult` takes a second argument `index`, which is the array index for the value that resulted in the current result. Here, the index is used to look up the original input value for the index, and set that as `foundValue`.
* When you provide a `stopEarly` function, you can cause the processing to stop before it would otherwise have. Here, we're done as soon as we've found a value. Noe that in case of `each`, the iterator will already have been called with all the values in the array, so only processing of results will stop. In case of `eachSeries`, it will prevent any further calls to `iterator`.
